# MastodonAgain

~~I did a bad thing.~~

A SwiftUI macOS only(-ish - also somewhat useful on iPad) Swift Concurrency based Mastodon Client.

## Requirements

This project is aimed at macOS 13 Ventura and higher. Back-porting to macOS 12 may be possible but would be a lot of work. Pull requests would be welcome but macOS 12 and older support is not and likely won't be a priority.

While it can compile and run on iOS 16 devices it has not been tested on any iOS devices at all. Focus is getting mac OS support running first - then bringing up iOS (and especially iPad) support.

## TODO
